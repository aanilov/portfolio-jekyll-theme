# Artem's practice


Hi, I'm Artem. Currently work in Baku, originally from Russia. I'm a student on the Business Analytics program. Really enjoying the course.
My major is economics, and currently I work as a finance manager on one of the oil and gas projects in Azerbaijan. My interests include business literature, art and traveling.
